Our application consist in sending and receiving emails from users.
In order to run this application there are two conditions:

1) If you are running this app whilst connected to our laptop, you only have to plug in your android phone to our laptop 
and run from Android Studio. 

2) If you are running it form your own laptop, you have to first configure this project on your own Android Studio version
in order to be able to integrate Google Sign In Option to your app and login with your own email. 
We have already included all the needed external libraries, but since Android Studio has a different SHA-1 (Secure Hash
Algorithm) in every laptop, you would have to do a configuration in your own laptop. 
In order to do this, follow this link :

https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating

and click Configure a project :
Project Name: signin
Project Product name: Talking Buddy
Package name: com.example.signin
SHA-1 : On the right side of your Android Studio go to GRADLE. Click app -> Tasks -> android -> signingReport and your SHA -1
will appear on your Run terminal. (Don't forget to change your configurations to app again, top part of your Android Studio, next to your device name).

Next, in MainActivity2.java, in this function:

        // Configure sign-in to request the user's ID, email address, and basic
        // profile. ID and basic profile are included in DEFAULT_SIGN_IN.
        GoogleSignInOptions gso = new GoogleSignInOptions.Builder(GoogleSignInOptions.DEFAULT_SIGN_IN)
                .requestIdToken("164440649285-bnlj0r0scdhn0rpl7un2gbbk94cmenki.apps.googleusercontent.com")
                .requestServerAuthCode("164440649285-bnlj0r0scdhn0rpl7un2gbbk94cmenki.apps.googleusercontent.com")
                .requestEmail()
                .build();

in your requestIdToken and requestServerAuthCode you have to put your email client ID. They will appear after you finish your 
project configuration you just have to copy it and paste it in between the quote marks. 

Now you are ready to sign in. 

For simplicity we would ask you to login with an email made specifically for this project since in it we have already made 
our Two Factor Authentication, have allowed less secure apps, and also have enabled IMAP and POP functions to retrieve and send emails.
Due to the fact that GMAIL is very strict when it comes to security, we had to do all these steps in our gmail. 
However, we absolutely DO NOT ADVICE YOU TO DO IT! This would make your gmail account more vunerable (due to allowing less seccure apps) and possibly put it at risk.
